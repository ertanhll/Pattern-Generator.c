Write a C program that prompts the user to enter an odd number between 1 and 9 inclusive, then prints a pattern based on that number. The pattern consists of the entered number printed in a symmetrical pattern. For example:

For input 9, the output pattern should be:
```
    9
   9
  9
 9
9
 9
  9
   9
    9
```
For input 7, the output pattern should be:
```
   7
  7
 7
7
 7
  7
   7
```
And so on...
